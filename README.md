## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses a trained Machine Learning model to predict survival based on:

- Passenger Class
- Sex
- Age
- Fare
- Number of Siblings/Spouses
- Number of Parents/Children
- Port of Embarkation

The application includes:

✅ Model built with Pipeline (Recommended)  
✅ Model built without Pipeline  
✅ Probability prediction (%)  
✅ Premium UI Design  
✅ Responsive Layout  
✅ Fast optimized loading  
✅ Portfolio-ready structure

## 🧠 Machine Learning

The model was trained on the Titanic dataset using:

- Scikit-learn
- Pipeline preprocessing
- OneHotEncoding
- Logistic Regression
